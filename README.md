## Substructure
-> not all modes are available for all device types

"fel" How-To for FEL build firmwares (autoroot via USB FEX mode, without actual reflashing)

"installer" How-To for installers (that require having root or shell access already)

"livesuit" How-To for Livesuit/Phoenixsuit images (reflashing via USB, more risky than FEL)

"update" Hot-To for normal firmware updates (that can be pushes via OTA commands or other ways)
