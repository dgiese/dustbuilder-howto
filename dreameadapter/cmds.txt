(You might want to have a firmware build before starting)
In the U-Boot shell run this commands:

setenv init /bin/sh
setenv boot_partition boot1
run setargs_nand
run boot_normal

Your robot should boot and present you a shell

After the system booted, run these commands:

/etc/init.d/sysconfig.sh
echo V > /dev/watchdog
/etc/init.d/mount_private.sh
/etc/init.d/mount_misc.sh

Run these commands to print the configuration (save output):

grep "" /mnt/private/ULI/factory/*

Run these commands to save the calibration (save output, outside of the robot):

grep "" /mnt/misc/*.json
grep "" /mnt/misc/*.yaml
cat /mnt/misc/*.txt
hexdump /mnt/misc/*.bin

Temporarily enable the shell and run the normal services:

mount /tmp
mkdir /tmp/fakeetc
cp -R /etc/* /tmp/fakeetc
mount --bind /tmp/fakeetc /etc
echo >> /tmp/fakeetc/inittab
echo '::respawn:-/bin/sh' >> /tmp/fakeetc/inittab
exec init

Run these commands to create binary backups:
mkdir -p /tmp/backup
tar -cvzf /tmp/backup/misc_backup.tgz -C /mnt/misc .
tar -cvzf /tmp/backup/factory.tgz -C /mnt/private/ULI/factory/ .
cp /tmp/backup/*.tgz /data/


Run this commands (replace SSID and password) to connect to your wifi (this will connect the robot to the internet and temporarily to the cloud):
wifi_cli -c "SSID" "password"

Run this commands to download an install the rooted firmware:
cd /tmp
wget {url-of-firmware.tar.gz}
tar -xzvf {name-of-firmware.tar.gz}
./install.sh

Sidenote: You can transfer the firmware via nc or via a local webserver. In that case you do not need to use wifi_cli

Download valetudo binary to /data:
https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo/releases
Device dependent (check our website):
1C, F9, D9: valetudo-armv7-lowmem
1T, L10 Pro, Z10 Pro: valetudo-aarch64
wget https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo/releases/latest/download/valetudo-armv7-lowmem -O /data/valetudo

Make valetudo executable
chmod +x /data/valetudo

Enable boot script
cp /misc/_root_postboot.sh.tpl /data/_root_postboot.sh
chmod +x /data/_root_postboot.sh

Reboot


(If you used wifi_cli, you need to delete files in /data/config/miio, reboot, connect to the robot WiFi and provision the WiFi via Valetudo):
rm /data/config/miio
reboot
- wait for the open WiFi of the robot to show up
- connect to that WiFi
- navigate to http://192.168.5.1 in your browser
- Got to settings/wifi and enter your WiFi credentials
