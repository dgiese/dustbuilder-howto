### General questions ###
Q: Which devices are currently rootable?
A: To my knowledge, all models released and all devices manufactured before mid-August 2021 are rootable.
Check the box for the manufacturing date.

Q: Where can I find information about the hardware (SoC, RAM, Flash)?
A: check here: https://dontvacuum.me/robotinfo/

Q: What is the current recommended rooting method?
A: The safest and easiest way to root is to use the "WiFi reset UART root", see below for more details

Q: Are devices manufactured after September 2021 rootable?
A: There is no experience yet. The exact countermeasures by the manufacturer are unknown at this time.
If you have such a new device, you might contact me before trying to root it.

Q: If the current rooting methods are blocked, will new rooting methods be released soon?
A: I publish rooting methods with a huge delay in order to prevent the manufacturer to block them. 
Expect the next wave of rooting methods to Defcon 2022.

Q: Which models are recommended for rooting?
A: Currently (Sept 2021), I would recommend to go with the Z10 Pro (p2028) or the L10 Pro (p2029, if you dont need a base station).
These models have a LIDAR sensor for navigation and have 512 MByte RAM, which should be enough for custom software. 
If you want to save money, you can also go with the D9 (p2009), but you might have issues due to 256 MByte of RAM. 
I personally would stay away from VSLAM-only devices.

Q: Can I use the cloud if I root my robot?
A: Yes, if you build your image without the "patch_dns" option, you will be still able to use the MiHome app. 
However, Valetudo will not work.

Q: Should I root my robot now?
A: If you plan to ever root your robot or use with custom software, you should root your robot *now*. And make
backups of all relevant configuration files. It is not known yet, how the vendor will lock down the devices.
So without rooting, you might get a forced update and get locked out of future root.

Q: Should I trick the dustbuilder with a fake serial number when my serial is rejected? Or should I modify the installer?
A: NO! People who tried that ended up with bricked devices. I added these checks for a reason...

Q: What is the first thing I should do when I have any sort of shell on the device?
A: Make backups of all files in /mnt/private/ULI/factory and /mnt/misc! And store them outside of the device!!!
The commands for the backup look like this (save all the outputs, some files might not exist on your model):
'grep "" /mnt/private/ULI/factory/*'
'grep "" /mnt/misc/*.json'
'grep "" /mnt/misc/*.yaml'
'cat /mnt/misc/*.txt'
'hexdump /mnt/misc/*.bin'

Q: Are you offering a 24/7 support? How fast will you provide support for new models or new firmware versions?
A: Rooting robots is a hobby for me. It may take days or even weeks to implement new features or models. Typically I wait
many weeks before rolling out new firmware version (in order to check for potential problems). As I finance the robots from
my personal funds (+ donations), I am limited in the number of different models I can get for testing and rooting. Currently,
I own 34 robots and it does not make financially sense to buy the same model every couple months to check for changes :(

Q: Is rooting dangerous? Should I root my robot directly after I got it?
A: There are various things which might go wrong while rooting. Make sure that you can accept a bricked device and that you
dont get trouble from your partner. I *strongly* recommend to let the robot run for a few days before you try to root it.
That way you get a feeling if the robot has problems or is broken. We had cases where it was not clear if problems came from
rooting or already existed on the device from the beginning.

Q: Why are all the howtos and information all over the place? Can't you write proper documentation?
A: Writing documentation takes a lot of time and is not really fun. I prefer to spend my time on hacking devices. This FAQ
should point you to the right ressources. Also, feel free to join the Telegram channel, where you can meet many people that
rooted their devices and can help you if you get stuck with the Howto's.

### Rooting questions ###
Q: Can be a rooted device reversed to stock firmware?
A: Yes, for most cases. As it might be individually different, you might want to contact me (Dennis) if you plan to do so.

Q: Are there remote root methods public, similar to the Xiaomi vaccum robot (aka roborock v1)?
A: No. All root methods require the removal of a plastic cover. However, we do not touch warranty seals.

Q: Which root methods are currently public?
A: There are "WiFi reset UART root", "U-Boot single user boot" and "FEL flashing". "WiFi reset UART root" is expected to
be patched very soon in newer firmware versions. "U-Boot single user boot" only works on 1C, F9, D9 and some MOVA models.
The "FEL flashing" should work on most devices, but carries a risk of bricking the device / loosing the calibration data.

Q: When do I need to build a Livesuit image?
A: You need the Livesuit image only for the FEL flashing method. However, currently it is strongly recommended to use a
safer method. The Livesuit image is not compatible with the UART based methods.

Q: What is the "WiFi reset UART root"?
A: Dreame left a function in the firmware, which enables a login shell. You need to be connected via UART. If the device is
fully booted, press the "WiFi reset" button for a short time (<=1 second). This will spawn a login shell, where you can login
using the "root" user and the device-specific root password. From there, you can install a "manual installation" custom firmware.

Q: How is the root password computed?
A: You need the serial number *under the dustbin* in all-caps. Compute it under linux by this command:
'echo -n "P2009XXXXXXXXXXXXX" | md5sum | base64'. The expected result is: 'Y2QxNjA4YjdhNWU1Y2RlNGQ3ODkzZjY4Yzk1MTVkOTAgIC0K'
For non-Linux user, you might use this formula:
'echo -n "P2009XXXXXXXXXXXXX" | md5'
'echo -n -e "*result from md5 above*"  -\n" | base64'

Q: Are there example howtos for the "WiFi reset UART root"?
A: Yes, a telegram channel member has created this document for the L10 Pro, which should apply for all devices (except backups might differ):
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1seCbcI2ZaUFZwOu_ibYgg7_yoR4OM0aDRkaXpAlxiFU/edit

Q: Which UART adapters can be used?
A: Make sure that the adapter is using 3.3V logic level. Check the datasheet of your adapter. Some adapters have jumpers to switch between
5V and 3.3V. You can alternatively use a Raspberry Pi or a ESP8266/ESP32 board.

### Valetudo / MQTT questions ###
Q: Can I use Valetudo and the MiHome App at the same time?
A: No. If you use Valetudo, all the Cloud traffic will be redirected. To enable the redirection, you need to select the "patch_DNS" option
in the Dustbuilder. This will effectively disconnect your robot from the Cloud.

Q: Does Valetudo support all the features that are provided thru the MiHome app?
A: No, some features (like Map editing, Mop zones, Timers) might not be available. Check http://valetudo.cloud for more details.

### Dustbuilder questions ###
Q: I don't trust you with my email address. Can I use a fake or a temporary one?
A: Don't use fake email, as you will not get your firmware. If you dont want to get many unsolicited spam emails from me, feel free to use a temporary one. 
If you prefer to stay anonymous, you can use also "anonymous" as the e-Mail address. This allows the generation without any email. 
However, the anonymous generation requires you to provide your public ssh key for technical reasons.
